Project for learning SSR and SSG in Next.js

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run build

npm run dev
```

Open (http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project has the Login Functionality, which has the login operation and allows you to learn the SSR.

SSG will be added soon.
